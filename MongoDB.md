## What is MongoDB?

- MongoDB is an open-source document-oriented type of NoSQL database that stores data in a flexible and easy to manage way.
- It is most suitable to handle large volumes of data and high traffic applications.
- Commonly used for web and mobile applications, content management systems and other data-intensive applications
- Stores data in a J-SON format, which are like documents, instead of tables.

## What are NoSQL databases? How do they differ from SQL?

- NoSQL databases are a type of database that do not use a traditional structured query language (SQL) for accessing and managing data.
- They are designed to handle unstructured or semi-structured data, making them well-suited for applications that need to handle large amounts of complex data
- NoSQL databases differ from SQL databases in that they do not use tables to store data, instead using various data models, such as key-value pairs, documents, or graphs.
- They also tend to be more horizontally scalable, allowing for easy expansion across multiple servers.

## Why is it so popular?

- It was first developed by 10gen, which is a software company founded by three software developers, and it was initially released in 2009.  It has gained popularity among developers and enterprises due to its ease of use, ability to handle large volumes of unstructured data, and support for flexible data models. Today, MongoDB is widely used in various industries, including healthcare, e-commerce, finance, and social media.

## What is seeding in MongoDB? Why do Mongo databases need to be seeded?

- It's the process of filling a database with fresh data (default data) to create a starting point for an application.
- The process makes sure that the database instances are all consistent and the application can be safely tested with the data given, which can help identify issues and debugg before launch.

## What port does MongoDB uses?

- By default, MongoDB uses port 27017.
